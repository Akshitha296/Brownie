DIRECTIONS:

Preheat the oven to 350°F then lightly grease an 8 x 8″ baking dish.
In a blender, combine the avocado, milk, maple syrup/honey and sugar. Blend for about 15-20 seconds, or until smooth.
In a large bowl, combine the flour/maida, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt then stir together. Pour the wet ingredients in the blender into the bowl with the dry. Add the chocolate chips and stir together until combined. Sprinkle a handful of chocolate chips on top then bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until set. You should be able to stick a fork in the center and have it come out clean. Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.
